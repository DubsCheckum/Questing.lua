Hi everyone,

**[introduction]**
this is a questing fork, with the intention to improve, expedite and update the master version to new hights.
So see this as a beta version of the next Questing update. The original project owner is still wiwi and as such,
all released versions will be found in his project: https://github.com/WiWi33/Questing.lua.

As it didn't get any attention lately, Questing contains open problems that prevent it from functioning - I'll
try to make it work again as fast as possible.

My current priority list:
1. mandatory fixes
2. some appointed features

For the time being I don't intend add:

3. new functionallity
4. new content

**[pointers]**
- _[branches]_ As I am developing multiple features at times, multiple branches will exist. Feel free to
debug test any of them. And give me feedback. They can be found, when clicking the *branch button* top left
over the current project.
- _[issues]_ When encountering once use githubs issue system. For the title I would prefer following format:
"banchName | shortIssueDescription". This is due to the fact, that I couldn't find any options for branch
related issue tagging.

One last statement: the more information (people using - people that actually provide some) I/we get, the
easier it is to narrow down the error source. Help me to help us all :)
Nice botting ;)
